      Mathura is the home for Indian I Corps (Strike Formation)[21][22] within
      the Indian Army's Central Command, hosting Strike I Corps headquarters in
      a large classified area in the outskirts of the city known as Mathura
      Cantonment (Central Command itself has its headquarters at Lucknow). It
      hosts Strike Infantry units, Air Defence units, Armoured Divisions,
      Engineer brigades, Aritillery Units and classified units of Strategic
      Nuclear Command. Corps I is primarily responsible for western borders of
      India. In 2007 during Exercise Ashwamedha, all the armoured, artillery and
      infantry divisions performed a simulation of an overall NBC
      (nuclear-chemical-biological) environment. The aim was to show operational
      ability in high intensity, short duration and 'sudden' battles.[23]
